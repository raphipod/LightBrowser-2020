# Who should use this browser?

Users with slow machines running Vista and up are greeted with an alternative browser, bringing the newest Chrome-Features to weak PCs, which are
otherwise not able to run Chrome smoothly.
Not only is it targeted to users with low-range hardware, it can also be used as an alternative browser which is not tracking your activity
or sending your browsing habits to companies.

LightBrowser is regularly updated, bringing new features, bug fixes and Chrome-Updates, to keep the browser up-to-date.
